        Bleach (stylized as BLEACH) is a Japanese anime television series based
        on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name. It was produced
        by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV
        Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story
        follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of
        a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from
        another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to
        take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding
        departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the manga
        series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original
        self-contained storylines and characters not found in the manga.
