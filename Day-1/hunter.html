        Hunter × Hunter (pronounced "hunter hunter") is a Japanese manga series
        written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in
        Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998,
        although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006.
        Its chapters have been collected in 36 tankōbon volumes as of October
        2018. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers
        that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a
        world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in
        fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal
        species, treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting
        down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter
        and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other
        Hunters and encounters the paranormal.
